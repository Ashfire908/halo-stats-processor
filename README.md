Halo Stats Processor
====================

Halo Stats Processor, or *Halo SP* (previously called ODST Game Stats Processor)
is a library for accessing and processing Halo statistics. Its primary function
is to retrieve data from Bungie.net, parse it, and return easily-accessible (and
possibly additional) stats for the developer to use in other projects. A full
list of the features of Halo SP is listed later on. Halo SP supports
Halo 3: ODST fully, with future full support for Halo: Reach and possibly Halo 3
planned.
